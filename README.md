## Study I: Structural and Semantic Patterns of IRSPs

**Inconsistently Rated Strong Passwords (IRSPs)** refer to passwords that are rated as "strong" by a majority of websites but fail to meet benchmark strength criteria. The figure below visualizes the distribution of IRSPs across structural and semantic dimensions at varying agreement thresholds.

**Figure 4.** Comparison of IRSP distributions across different agreement thresholds (from >50% to >90%). Each subplot shows the same arrangement–subcategory space for visual comparison. X-axis subcategories are grouped by letter categories; Y-axis arrangements are color-coded by the number of character types (3-type vs. 4-type). Dot size indicates the frequency of each combination.
